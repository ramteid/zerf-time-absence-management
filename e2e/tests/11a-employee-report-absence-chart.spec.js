// File 11a: the Employee report, viewed by someone who is looking at *another*
// person — the path a team lead or admin uses to review an individual.
//
// Every earlier spec views a report as the person it belongs to, and every
// absence the suite books lies in the future. That combination left the report's
// flextime chart untested for the one case that actually broke in production:
// a chart whose period contains an absence day. Colouring such a day is the only
// branch that reads the absence-category list, and it threw, which aborted the
// render of the whole report — the employee could be picked from the dropdown
// but their report stayed empty. Reports for people without absences kept
// working, so it looked like only certain employees were affected.
//
// Runs after 11 (all approvals are final) and before 12 (which archives the
// employee and would remove her from the report dropdown).
