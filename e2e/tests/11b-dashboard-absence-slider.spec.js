// File 11b: the dashboard's "Who is absent" tile (AbsenceSlider.svelte) —
// week-by-week navigation and the sick-leave rows it's meant to surface.
//
// Reported production bugs this file reproduces:
//   1. "Switching weeks with the prev/next arrows isn't reliable, and the
//      displayed date doesn't update even when it did switch correctly."
//   2. "Not every employee with a sick-leave entry actually shows up in the
//      tile" (observed with several sick-leave entries across a month).
//
// Root cause (frontend/src/routes/dashboard/AbsenceSlider.svelte): clicking
// prev/next fires a new fetch without waiting for the previous one to
// finish, and the result was applied unconditionally regardless of which
// request it belonged to. Two requests can be in flight at once; if a
// slower response for an *earlier* click resolves after a faster response
// for a *later* click, it silently overwrites the correct, newer data with
// stale (or empty) data — the header (bound to a separate `week` variable)
// already shows the right range, but the row list underneath reverts. With
// several sick-leave weeks in a row, that looks exactly like "some people's
// sick leave never shows up", depending on which responses happen to race.
//
// Two dedicated people (not EMPLOYEE/ASSISTANT/TEAM_LEAD from users.js) are
// onboarded so the exact contents of four specific past weeks are known and
// under this file's sole control — no other spec places absences far enough
// back to collide with them (see pastWeekWorkday in helpers.js).
//
// Runs after 11a (all approvals settled) and before 12 (which archives the
// shared employee — irrelevant here, but keeps the numbering consistent).
