//! Monthly payroll report email to the tax office / payroll accountant.
//!
//! Schedule — identical to the Nextcloud timesheet export (`report_upload`),
//! both built on `background::schedule`:
//!   1. Each midnight tick: once `today.day() >= payroll_report_day_of_month`,
//!      queue the previous month (idempotent, guarded by the
//!      `payroll_report_queue_period` app_setting; missed months are backfilled).
//!   2. Process queued periods: a period is sent only when every employee it
//!      covers has a final month. Otherwise it stays queued and is retried on
//!      the next daily check, so late submitters are caught up automatically.
//!      Before the configured day of month, older catch-up periods are still
//!      processed while the just-finished previous month waits.
//!
//! Finality is the shared `month_export_readiness` gate, plus one extra rule:
//! for everybody whose *hours* are in the report, all time entries of the month
//! must be approved. Payroll pays by those hours, so reporting a draft or
//! not-yet-approved month would understate what is owed. This relaxation is
//! specific to *what goes in the document* — the dashboard tile asks a
//! stricter, unconditional question (everyone's own submitted+approved
//! status) and must not reuse it; see `services::payroll_report::evaluate_members`.
//!
//! A blocked scheduled period is **not** an error: people simply have not
//! finished their month yet. It is logged and otherwise stays silent — the
//! payroll dashboard tile (`services::payroll_report::build_status`) is where
//! admins and team leads see who is still missing.
//!
//! `run_now` (admin "Send now" button) sends exactly one month immediately,
//! skipping the day-of-month threshold, and never removes a period from the
//! queue — the regular scheduled delivery still goes out separately. Which
//! month it picks, and how much it waits for, is [`SendMode`].
