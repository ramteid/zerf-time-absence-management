//! Admin-made, dated changes to an employee's flextime balance.
//!
//! Every flextime balance in the app is "worked minutes minus target minutes,
//! accumulated day by day". Some changes to that balance have no worked hours
//! behind them at all: the hours somebody already carried when their account
//! was opened, an overtime payout, a negotiated reset. Those are recorded here
//! as one dated booking each, and the report pipeline folds them into the
//! ledger on their effective date exactly the way it folds in a day's
//! worked-minus-target difference.
//!
//! This replaces the old `users.overtime_start_balance_min` setting, where a
//! single editable number silently rewrote a person's entire flextime history
//! whenever it changed. See migration 043.
