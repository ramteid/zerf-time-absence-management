//! Monthly payroll report: configuration and data assembly.
//!
//! The report is one PDF per month for the whole company, emailed to the
//! payroll accountant / tax office. It replaces a hand-maintained spreadsheet
//! and therefore contains exactly what payroll needs to file:
//!   * absence days per employee for the categories that are automatically
//!     payroll-relevant (see [`AbsenceCategory::is_payroll_relevant`]) — sick
//!     days drive health-insurance reimbursement, unpaid days reduce the
//!     salary payout,
//!   * working days and worked hours per assistant (and optionally per
//!     employee), which is what assistants are paid by.
//!
//! Scheduling lives in `background::payroll_report`; this module only decides
//! *what* is in the document.
