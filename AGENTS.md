# Zerf - Agent Reference

Zerf (Zeiterfassung) is a self-hosted time tracking and absence management platform for teams. It covers working hours, leave requests, approvals, and monthly reports. Data stays on your infrastructure.

## General style
- Use simple language, concise and natural formulations.

## Development Workflow

- All development happens on `main`.
- Do not create feature branches or pull requests unless explicitly requested.

## Repository Layout

```
backend/      Rust/Axum HTTP API + PostgreSQL integration
frontend/     Svelte 5 single-page app
docker/       Docker Compose configurations and Dockerfiles
migrations/   SQL migrations (backend/migrations/)
scripts/      Backup utility
```

## Backend

**Language/Runtime**: Rust (Edition 2021), async Tokio multi-thread runtime
**Framework**: Axum 0.8
**Database**: PostgreSQL via sqlx 0.8 (compile-time checked queries, built-in migrations)
**Crate name**: `zerf`

### Key dependencies

| Crate | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| axum + tower | HTTP routing and middleware |
| sqlx | PostgreSQL queries and migrations |
| argon2 + subtle | Password hashing and constant-time comparison |
| rand | CSPRNG (session tokens) |
| lettre | SMTP email delivery |
| reqwest | External holiday API calls |
| chrono | Date/time |
| csv | Report CSV export |
| tracing | Structured logging |
| testcontainers | Postgres containers for integration tests |

### Architecture: 3-layer structure

The backend is organised into three strict layers. See `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the full spec.

```
handlers/ → services/ → repository/
```

| Layer | Location | Rule |
|-------|----------|------|
| **Handlers** | `src/handlers/*.rs` | HTTP only. Extract request, call service, return JSON. No `sqlx`, no `repository` imports. |
| **Services** | `src/services/*.rs` | Business logic. Own transactions, dispatch notifications. No `axum::extract/response`. |
| **Repository** | `src/repository/*.rs` | SQL only. No business rules. Only `AppError::NotFound` via `From<sqlx::Error>`. |

Additional modules:

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `middleware/auth.rs` | `auth_middleware`, `User` struct, cookie/token/CSRF helpers — single source of `User` |
| `background/` | Scheduled loops: submission reminders, approval reminders, holiday seeding, monthly timesheet upload, monthly payroll report |
| `state.rs` | `AppState` definition |
| `router.rs` | Route declarations (`build_api_router`, `build_app`) |
| `config.rs` | Environment variable loading |
| `db.rs` | Connection pool setup |
| `error.rs` | `AppError`, `AppResult` |
| `audit.rs` | Audit log dispatch |
| `email.rs` | SMTP delivery via lettre |
| `i18n.rs` | Backend translations |
| `time_calc.rs` | Time duration helpers |

**Key types:**

| Type | Location | Role |
|------|----------|------|
| `AppState` | `state.rs` | Holds `pool`, `db` (repo façade), `cfg`, `notifications` |
| `User` | `middleware/auth.rs` | Authenticated requester extracted by `auth_middleware` |
| `repository::Db` | `repository/mod.rs` | Façade owning all sub-repositories |
| `*Db` (e.g. `UserDb`) | `repository/*.rs` | Domain-specific query collections |

**Sub-repositories** (fields on `repository::Db`):

`sessions`, `users`, `time_entries`, `flextime_adjustments`, `absences`, `reopen_requests`, `categories`, `holidays`, `notifications`, `audit`, `settings`, `reports`, `export_queue`, `payroll_queue`, `error_queue`, `email_queue`

**Access patterns in services:**

```rust
// Simple reads via the façade
let entries = app_state.db.time_entries.list_for_user(user_id, from, to).await?;

// Transaction-bound writes (services own the transaction lifecycle)
let mut tx = app_state.db.users.begin().await?;
SubDb::method_tx(&mut *tx, ...).await?;
tx.commit().await?;
// Dispatch notifications AFTER commit:
services::notifications::create(...).await?;

// Standalone context (background tasks)
let user = UserDb::new(pool.clone()).find_by_id(id).await?;
```

**Type conversion:** Repository structs are converted to service/response types via `repo_*_to_service()` helpers located in the relevant service module (e.g. `services::users::repo_user_to_auth_user()`).

**Rules:**
- SQL is allowed only in `backend/src/repository/*.rs` (plus `db.rs` bootstrap).
- Handlers must not import `sqlx` or `crate::repository`.
- Services must not import `axum::extract`, `axum::response`, or `axum::routing`.
- All new database operations must go through repository methods.

### Background tasks (spawned in main.rs)

- Auth cleanup: purge expired sessions and login attempts (hourly)
- Notification cleanup: delete notifications older than 90 days (daily)
- Holiday scheduler: ensure current and next year holidays exist (weekly, Monday noon)
- Submission reminder scheduler (also carries two month-boundary passes, both at
  08:00 on every third day from the 1st — `month_reminder_is_due_now`).
  `run_month_end_check` asks the assistants who still hold a booking they never
  handed in; `run_month_weeks_reminder` names the finished month's missing weeks
  for people with a target schedule, where a bookingless week *is* evidence —
  for an assistant it is not. The week straddling the turn of the month joins
  that list only from its Friday and is judged solely on its in-month days
  (`reports::unsubmitted_weeks_in_month`). Both re-decide their audience on
  every run and only fire on something genuinely missing: a week handed in and
  merely awaiting a decision is the approver's move, not the employee's. They
  repeat rather than firing once because what they ask for is exactly what holds
  the payroll report up — chasing it once would leave a report blocked by
  something nobody is being reminded of, and would lose the whole month's
  reminder to a restart on the 1st. The deadline named is the organisation's own
  `submission_deadline_day`, with the payroll send day − 1 as a fallback; past
  that date the message drops to the plain missing-weeks wording rather than
  naming a day that has gone by)
- Approval reminder scheduler (weekly, plus a **month-end pass** on the same
  every-third-day rhythm for days of the finished month that are handed in but
  undecided — an undecided day holds the payroll report, so it is chased until
  it is decided, not once)
- Monthly timesheet PDF upload to Nextcloud (daily, after midnight)
- Monthly payroll report email to the tax office (daily, after midnight)
- Error-notification worker: drains `error_notification_queue` and alerts opted-in admins in-app + by email (poll every 10s)
- Email queue worker: drains `email_queue` and delivers via SMTP, guarded by a shared circuit breaker (poll every 2 minutes)

Both monthly jobs share `background/schedule.rs` (daily loop, `YYYY-MM` period
math, queue backfill through the previous month, day-of-month deferral) and the
`services::reports::month_export_readiness` gate, so they judge "this month is
final" by the same rules.

**Weeks, never days.** Submitting and approving are week-level operations in the
product, not day-level: `Submit Week` hands in every draft of that week and the
approver decides a `(user, week)` group as one block (`buildPendingWeeks`). No
UI can approve a single entry, and `roles::has_submission_obligation` does *not*
carve anyone out of that workflow — assistants submit and get approved like
everyone else; the flag only says whose weeks may be *demanded* to be complete.
Every completeness/finality judgement in the app works on
whole ISO weeks. `reports::week_is_accounted_for` is the single implementation:
because submitting and approving cover a week at a time, a single day carrying
the required status *is* the whole week being handed in, regardless of how many
days the person worked and regardless of
`workdays_per_week`; a week with nothing booked passes only when nothing was
due (every potential workday a holiday, an absence, or before the start date).
`workdays_per_week` survives in that function purely as the potential-day pool
(Mon-Fri vs. the full week) — it is no longer a quota, because counting days
punished part-timers whose real pattern is shorter than their contract's day
count. Target hours and leave-day maths are a different question and still cap
per week at `workdays_per_week`. `time_calc::counted_workdays` is the single
implementation of that calendar, and it returns the *days*, not just their
number, because the cap has to be applied once across the whole window and the
buckets cut out of the result afterwards. Counting two narrower windows applies
the cap to each: "taken up to today" plus "upcoming from tomorrow", or the
halves either side of a carryover expiry, billed one straddling week twice over.
Everything else — `count_workdays`, `workdays_for_ranges_in_window*`, the leave
tiles, the team report's taken/planned columns, the carryover chain and the
leave-account budget check — goes through it. A proposed absence is priced as
the difference between the year counted with it and without it, never on its
own, so a week already partly booked cannot cost its quota a second time —
pricing it alone rejected requests that in fact fit.

`time_calc::counted_days_per_range` is the per-range counterpart, for callers
that print or bill each range separately and still need those numbers to add up
to what the week costs: it returns one count per range, attributing the counted
days in chronological order. The payroll report's absence rows — the ordinary
table and the catch-up one alike — go through it, per person and across every
row the document prints for them. Counting each absence with `count_workdays`
re-applied the quota to each of them, so two sick notes inside one calendar week
claimed more days of continued pay from a part-time contract than that week can
ever hold.

The frontend mirrors that calendar rather than keeping a second one:
`apiMappers.js` exports `countedWorkdays` (the union count, with `countWorkdays`
as its single-range case, exactly as `count_workdays` delegates in Rust) and
`withAbsenceDays`, which attributes the counted days to the absences that
produced them in chronological order. Every page showing a leave-day figure —
the Absences list, the person report's stat cards, the team report's absence
table — goes through `withAbsenceDays`. Counting each absence on its own, which
is what those pages used to do, re-applied the weekly quota per absence: for a
part-timer with two bookings in one calendar week the page reported more leave
than that week can ever cost, and contradicted the balance shown beside it.

Auto-break tiers are compared in **whole minutes** (`exclusive_threshold_minutes`)
everywhere they are compared at all: the settings endpoint refuses a second
threshold that does not exceed the first at that resolution, and both
`services::reports::build_break_rules` and the frontend's `buildBreakRules`
collapse two tiers that land on the same minute onto the first. Comparing hours
instead let 6.0 and 6.008 through as two tiers, and the two renderers then
disagreed about which deduction applied. Every "total hours" figure takes the
report's own break-adjusted `actual_min` rather than re-summing the raw entry
minutes printed beside it — the server-side CSV, the timesheet PDF
(`range_total_minutes`) and the browser's own CSV export (`buildTimesheetCsv`)
alike. The entry rows deliberately stay raw; only the total is net, and
re-summing the rows to get it silently drops the deduction.
`reports::weeks_in_month_to_judge` decides *which* weeks a completeness check
sees: every week that overlaps the period and has already started, the one being
worked included. A week belongs to a month as soon as any of its days do.
`reports::JudgedDays` decides which *days* of those weeks may be looked at.
Month-scoped checks (Submissions tile, month report, timesheet export gate,
month-end reminders) clamp to the month, so a draft booked in the new month
never makes the old one look unfinished and handing in the month's last day
settles it. That includes the month report's own `weeks_all_submitted` /
`weeks_all_approved` pair (`submission_status_for_month`) and the
still-awaiting-a-decision query behind it: both are bounded to the month, or the
dashboard contradicts the Submissions tile in the very same response. A freely chosen date range does *not* clamp — it is a window
somebody is looking through, not an accounting period, so its boundary weeks are
judged whole (`build_range_for_page` passes `None`, `build_month` clamps).
`reports::judged_period_end` bounds the entry-status questions the same way.
A month boundary is where the week rule and the calendar collide: a month ending
on a Monday puts its last day in a week that is not over until after the payroll
report is due. Nothing in the model needed changing — `Submit Week` hands in
whatever drafts exist, and the approver sees them as their own week block — but
the reminders above ask for those days, and `background::payroll_report`'s
`notify_admins_of_hold` tells the admins once per period
(`PAYROLL_REPORT_BLOCKED_NOTIFIED_KEY`) when a scheduled report is waiting and on
whom. The blocked path itself still neither errors nor retries differently.

**What the payroll report holds, and what holds it back.** The document prints
two things: the payroll-relevant absence days (sick-like or unpaid) of everyone
*except* assistants — `build_absence_rows` skips them, because an hourly worker
has no continued pay — and the working days and hours of the assistants, plus
everybody else when `payroll_report_include_employee_hours` is on. Only approved
entries and approved absences produce rows. `payroll_members` therefore admits an
assistant on recorded time alone; an absence of theirs cannot bring them in.

Three things hold the send back, and each is something the wait demonstrably
changes:

1. `UnapprovedEntries::AnyUnsettled` for anyone whose hours are printed — a
   draft, a submitted row, an unresolved rejection. Each is a booking that
   *exists*, so the work happened, and the document counts only approved
   minutes. Deliberately about entries, never weeks.
2. `PendingAbsences::PayrollRelevant` — an undecided request in a printed
   category, and never an assistant's. (The timesheet archive takes
   `PendingAbsences::Any` and `UnapprovedEntries::AnyUnsettled` for everyone:
   its document is one person's whole month.)
3. Content stored before a start date, which every renderer hides.

**Working time changed after its month was reported.** A late booking or a
change to an already-declared day belongs in a later report under its affected
date. `PayrollLateEntryRow` is therefore a signed correction: positive minutes
add time and negative minutes reduce it. The live path recomputes the whole
approved person-day, including one automatic-break deduction across all shifts,
then subtracts everything payroll has already received for that day.

Two records serve different purposes. `time_entries.payroll_reported_period`
records **that an entry row existed when a report was produced**. It deliberately
does not mean "these hours were paid", because the settings deciding whose hours
are printed can change. `payroll_reported_days` (migration 047) is the append-only
value ledger: one signed net-minute row per `(period, user, day)`. Summing a
person-day gives the exact total already declared. An unchanged delete/rebook
therefore produces zero, adding a shift carries only the net increase, and a
cross-month move produces a negative old-day correction plus a positive new-day
correction.

Migration 047 has no backfill. Exact historic day totals cannot be reconstructed
from row markers, and inventing zero would dump the full history into the next
report. `payroll_reported_periods` records every month settled with the ledger
available, so a missing day in one of those months is a known zero baseline. A
missing day from an older month stays on the marker-based behavior permanently,
even after that fallback prints a correction; recording only the new delta
would mistake it for the unknown full baseline on the next report. Migration
044 already marked every entry that existed when catch-up reporting was
introduced, so enabling the feature still cannot dump pre-existing history.

On a scheduled send, `PayrollReportData::declared_work_days` carries the exact
regular day totals and signed corrections from the assembled document to the
sender. `ReportDb::record_payroll_report_delivery` writes those ledger rows,
stores the exact rendered rows for delivered-card readback, marks the printed
absences and time entries, and removes the queue row in one transaction.
Own-period entries are marked only from the exact `(id,
updated_at)` snapshot captured before report assembly; an entry created or
materially edited while the document is built stays unmarked for a later
correction. Older approved rows are marked only on the exact `(user, day)` pairs
the document printed. The settle-without-sending branches pass empty
declarations and carried-day lists. If any write fails, the transaction rolls
back and the period remains queued. Manual sends never record declarations or
markers because the scheduled copy is still to come.

`payroll_reported_content` stores the ordered dashboard projection of each
post-migration delivery. A delivered card reads that snapshot instead of
reapplying current inclusion settings, exclusions, names, category labels, or
absence state to an old document. The stored user id is used only for the
viewer's current visibility check. Periods sent before migration 047 have no
snapshot and retain the marker-based readback.

A material edit to a ledger-backed entry clears its row marker, even inside the
same month, so the whole day can be compared with its declared total. A legacy
row with no ledger retains the established behavior: an edit inside the same
month keeps its marker and a cross-month move clears it.

A legacy day still gets the whole-day break computation, though, not just the
established marker behavior for *whether* it stays marked. The marked rows
were never deleted, only marked, so their current minutes are live, queryable
data — `late_entry_deltas` recomputes them the same way it recomputes the
whole day, and the correction is the difference. Pricing a newly added shift
in isolation, as the very first version of this feature did, silently
under-deducts the break whenever the *combined* day crosses a threshold the
new shift alone does not — exactly the bug the ledger exists to fix, still
live for every already-reported day the ledger cannot backfill.

`services::payroll_report::carry_over_boundary` decides how far back that
reaches, and returns the whole `CarriedDays` scope rather than a single date.
Three bounds, each guarding a different way of getting it wrong:

* `before` — the reported month's own start. Everything from there on belongs
  to its regular sections.
* `owed_periods` — every month whose own report is still to come, skipped
  individually rather than collapsed into "everything from the oldest one
  onwards". The queue can have gaps: one month stuck behind a late approval
  while later months were delivered must not freeze carry-over for those later
  months too, possibly for as long as the stuck month lasts. It is the queue
  **plus** `periods_to_backfill`, because a month is owed before it is queued —
  the queue is filled at the start of a run, so for the first days of every
  month, before the send day, the month just finished is due and absent from
  it. Reading the queue alone let the running month's card offer that whole
  month as catch-up days while its own report was still to come.
* `since` — the start of the very first period ever queued
  (`payroll_report_first_period`, written once by `queue_previous_month`).
  Without it the *first* report an installation ever sends would sweep in every
  approved entry created between migration 044 and the day payroll reporting was
  switched on: `queue_previous_month` runs before anything asks
  "has a report been delivered?", so the "nothing queued yet → carry nothing"
  branch is already unreachable by then. Installations predating this key fall
  back to a permissive floor — migration 044 already marked everything that
  existed for them, so there is no history to protect them from, and a
  restrictive fallback would silently switch carry-over off for exactly the
  installations that have been running longest.

The scope travels in `ReportWindow::carried`. The live path reads candidate
person-days through `ReportDb::carried_day_entries_before`, calculates their
current net totals, and subtracts `declared_minutes_for_days`. A
`PayrollCarryScope` carries the same date bounds plus the exact printed
person-days, so marking cannot widen beyond the document. A day with an
unsettled entry — draft, submitted, or an unresolved rejection — is deferred
rather than treated as a deletion while a reopened correction is still in
progress; unsettled rows in a month still owed belong to that month's own
report and do not block older corrections. The deferral is scoped per
`(user, day)`, not per person: a reopen touches the days it actually reopened,
so an unrelated day's correction must not wait on a different day's edit, and a
single abandoned draft nobody ever resubmits cannot suppress every correction
someone is owed. `CarriedDays::reported_as`
picks the direction: `None` asks what a report produced now would correct;
`Some(period)` asks what that period actually declared. Post-migration reports
read both their regular hours and correction rows through
`declared_days_for_period`; reports with no ledger rows fall back to
`time_entries_reported_in_range` and the older marker queries. The dashboard card
uses the historical form for a delivered month, so later edits cannot rewrite
"what this month's report contained" or show the same time in two months.
Absences carry the same protection through a
second marker, `absences.payroll_reported_period` (migration 046), and they
need it *more* than entries do: `AbsenceCategory::is_payroll_relevant` is
`auto_approve_past OR unpaid`, so a sick-like absence entered for past dates is
approved on the spot. It never sits in `requested`, never trips
`PendingAbsences::PayrollRelevant`, and therefore cannot hold its own month's
report back — it just turns up after that month was filed. Without carry-over
those days reach no document at all and continued pay is never claimed.
`build_late_absence_rows` prints them under their real dates, and the mark
records the *first* period that showed any part of an absence, which is what
lets one column serve an absence spanning a month boundary: the marker gates
only the catch-up path, so each month's report still prints its own clamped
part normally. A delivered month's card shows no catch-up absences at all,
since a "first period" marker cannot answer "what did period P carry".

An absence is a *range*, which is where it stops resembling the entries path.
`reportable_segments` cuts the months still owed out of that range instead of
dropping the absence whole: a sick note running from a reported month into one
whose report is stuck must have its earlier days declared now, because the owed
month's report marks the absence the moment it prints its own half and the
catch-up path never looks at it again. It returns several stretches where it
has to, and the rows go through `merge_continuous_illness_rows` like the main
table's, so a catch-up row cannot carry a certificate verdict earned on a
longer period than it shows. The absences a document declared travel back to
the sender on the document itself (`PayrollReportData::late_absence_ids`) and
are exactly what `mark_payroll_reported_absences` marks — deriving that set
from a second query is what produced the read/mark drift bugs this feature kept
hitting, where days were either declared twice or marked without ever being
printed.

`payroll_members` takes corrections too, because somebody whose only activity is
an older changed day has no row in the month now being reported and may since
have been deactivated. The live member set uses only nonzero calculated deltas,
so an unchanged rebook cannot create a permanent phantom member. A delivered
report gets its historic users from that period's declaration ledger, with the
old entry-marker lookup only as the migration-047 fallback. The Submissions tile
passes `None`: an older correction says nothing about whether this month is
closed. A carried *absence* widens the member set only for non-assistants,
mirroring the rule that an assistant's absence never appears in the report.

`require_week_submission` is `false` for payroll and `true` for the archive. An
unhanded-in week proves nothing here: an assistant with no target schedule may
simply not have worked it, and a salaried employee's hours are not in the
document at all. `reports::JudgedDays` clamps a week-level check to the days of
one month, which is what lets the straddling week be settled by its in-month
days alone.

`reports::weeks_submission_counts` counts the same weeks for the personal
report's Submissions tile ("x of y weeks", month *and* custom range) — it hangs
off `build_month` and `build_range_for_page` only, never the plain
`build_range` the CSV and PDF paths use, so a team PDF does not pay for a week
scan per person.

**Email delivery** (`email.rs`, `background/email_queue.rs`): almost every
outbound email (password resets, absence decisions, reminders, error alerts)
goes through `services::notifications::deliver` → `email::queue_email`, which
persists the already-rendered subject/body to `email_queue` rather than
sending it inline. The background worker above drains that table every 2 minutes (new messages
first, then previously-failed ones least-recently-retried first — so one
undeliverable message can't monopolize the circuit breaker's retry slot and
starve everything queued behind it) and deletes a row only once SMTP
confirmed delivery — a message that keeps failing simply stays queued and is
retried indefinitely, so a transient SMTP outage can no longer silently lose
an email. That delete is itself retried a few times (idempotent — deleting an
already-gone row is a no-op) before giving up, so a momentary DB hiccup right
after a confirmed send can't leave the row looking untouched and cause the
same email to go out again next cycle; the payroll report's own period
delete gets the identical treatment for the same reason. Enqueueing
itself is gated on `SettingsDb::load_smtp_config()` returning `Some`
(SMTP enabled and fully configured); if SMTP is disabled after messages are
already queued, they are left in place untouched rather than dropped or
warned about. A shared `email::CircuitBreaker` (5 consecutive failures opens
it; a 5-minute cooldown then grants one half-open trial) guards every real
SMTP attempt so a longer outage stops being retried on every poll; the
breaker is shared with the payroll report's own `send_with_attachment` call so
both paths back off together. A row is only logged as a system warning (not
raised as an admin notification, to avoid emailing about email being broken)
once it has failed 100 delivery attempts — logged once at that threshold, not
repeated on every attempt after. The one exception that bypasses the queue
entirely is the monthly payroll report PDF, which already has its own
period-keyed retry queue (`payroll_report_queue`) with "stays queued until
confirmed sent" semantics; it still routes its actual SMTP transaction
through the same breaker-guarded sender. The admin's SMTP "test connection"
probe also bypasses both the queue and the breaker deliberately — it never
sends a real message and must not be blocked by unrelated breaker state.

| `user_leave_accounts` | Per-user base entitlement for each leave-account absence category |
| `user_leave_account_year_overrides` | Per-user leave-account entitlement overrides by year |

Notable constraints: non-admin users must have an approver; users cannot approve themselves; vacation range <= 1 year; time entry end_time >= start_time; at most one `opening_balance` row and at most one reversal per row in `flextime_adjustments`.

**Flextime balances.** A balance is `sum(worked - target) through the flextime
cutoff + sum(flextime_adjustments effective on or before the date asked for)`.
The carry-in balance used to live in `users.overtime_start_balance_min`, where
editing it silently rewrote the employee's whole reported history; migration 043
moved every value into `flextime_adjustments` and then dropped the column, so
there is no second, writable copy of the same fact left anywhere. That makes the
migration one-way: an older binary still selects the column and cannot start
against a migrated database. Adjustments are **not** capped at the
flextime cutoff — an admin booking is authoritative immediately — and one dated
before a user's start date is pulled forward to that date, so moving a start
date relocates it instead of dropping it. The table is **append-only**: rows are
never updated or deleted, and a wrong entry is cancelled by a row carrying the
opposite minutes on the same date (`reverses_id`). Deleting would reintroduce
the original defect, so there is no delete endpoint. Effective dates may lie in
the future; every balance query asks "effective on or before date X", so a
future booking simply has not applied yet. `reports::flextime_effective_through`
is the single answer to what "on or before" means — `today.max(start_date)`, so
the carry-in booked on a contract start that is still ahead shows up the moment
a view reaches that date. Every balance view (the ledger, the monthly overtime
rows, the team report's balance and monthly-movement columns) bounds its
adjustment queries with it; when one of them used plain `today` instead, that
employee's balance read zero beside a ledger that already carried the booking.
The account dialog (`services::flextime_adjustments::account`) has no adjustment
query of its own — it reads the ledger for a single day — so it bounds *that
day* with the same function. Reading it at `today.max(cutoff)` instead reported
zero for a new hire whose contract starts next month, because their cutoff (and
so the day read) still lies before their own start date.

A week is judged only once it is over: `approved_weeks` never looks at the week
containing today, because "every required day is approved" would be a verdict on
a week that can still gain entries.

### Build

```
# Development
cargo build

# Production (strip + thin LTO)
cargo build --release
```

## Frontend

**Framework**: Svelte 5.55.5
**Build tool**: Vite 8.0.10
**Test runner**: Vitest 4.1.5 + jsdom
**Linter**: ESLint 10 + eslint-plugin-svelte (covers JS and `.svelte` files)
**Dev server port**: 5173 (proxies `/api` and `/healthz` to `http://127.0.0.1:3333`)
**Build output**: `frontend/dist/`

### NPM scripts

| Script | Command | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `dev` | `vite` | Start dev server |
| `build` | `vite build` | Production build |
| `lint` | `eslint .` | Lint all JS and Svelte files |
| `format` | `prettier --check` | Check formatting |
| `format:write` | `prettier --write` | Auto-format |
| `test` | `vitest run` | Run tests |

### Linting

ESLint is configured via `frontend/eslint.config.js` and covers **both** `.js` and `.svelte` files using `eslint-plugin-svelte`.

**Run before committing:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run lint
```

**Key rules in effect:**
- `no-unused-vars` / `no-unused-imports` — remove dead imports/variables
- `svelte/require-each-key` — every `{#each}` block must have a key expression `(item.id)`
- `no-dupe-keys` — no duplicate keys in object literals (catches i18n mistakes)
- `svelte/no-immutable-reactive-statements` — don't write `$:` blocks whose inputs never change

**Intentional suppressions (do not remove):**
- `svelte/prefer-svelte-reactivity` — disabled globally; using native `Map`/`Set`/`Date` is acceptable
- `svelte/no-reactive-functions` — disabled; Svelte 4-era rule that crashes on ESLint 10
- `<!-- eslint-disable-next-line svelte/no-at-html-tags -->` in `Icons.svelte` — SVG icon content is trusted static markup
- `// eslint-disable-next-line no-useless-assignment` on reactive tracker variables — ESLint cannot see cross-reactive-statement usage (e.g. `$: lastX = x;` paired with `$: if (x !== lastX) { ... }`)
- `// eslint-disable-next-line svelte/infinite-reactive-loop` — false positives when assignments occur inside `.then()` callbacks within `$:` blocks

### Key source files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/api.js` | Fetch wrapper: CSRF header injection, 401/session-expiry handling, error mapping |
| `src/stores.js` | Svelte stores: current user, categories, routing path, notifications |
| `src/i18n.js` | Translation tables (en, de), localStorage preference |
| `src/App.svelte` | Root component, boot logic, session expiry gate |
| `src/Layout.svelte` | Main layout |
| `src/apiMappers.js` | Response-to-domain object mapping |
| `src/dialogs/` | Modal dialogs (AbsenceDialog, EntryDialog, CategoryDialog, etc.) |
| `src/routes/` | Page components (Time, Absences, Calendar, Reports, Admin*, Account) |
| `src/styles/` | Global stylesheet modules, imported in order by `index.css` |

### Styling

- Global styles are split into ordered modules under `src/styles/` (tokens,
  base, buttons, badges, forms, layout, components, pages, feedback,
  notifications, responsive). `index.css` imports them in cascade order —
  `responsive.css` must stay last so its media queries win.
- **No inline `style=` attributes.** Shared/repeated patterns belong in the
  matching `src/styles/` module; page- or component-specific one-offs belong in
  that component's scoped `<style>` block. Truly dynamic values (colors from
  data, computed positions) use Svelte `style:property={value}` directives.
- Font sizes are declared in `rem`. The root size in `base.css` is the single
  knob for the type scale: 100% (16px) as default, raised to 106.25% (17px)
  on desktop viewports (>1024px). Never hardcode `px` font sizes.
- `base.css` provides small utilities for the most common one-liners
  (`.flex-1`, `.text-right`, `.text-tertiary`, `.fs-14`, `.mt-8`/`.mb-12` etc.)
  plus `.zf-row`/`.zf-col` stacks - reuse them before writing a new class.
- Page content is width-capped and centered via `--page-max-width` (default
  1200px), applied as horizontal padding on `.top-bar` and `.content-area`.
  Form-heavy pages narrow it with the `.page-narrow` (640px) or `.page-medium`
  (760px) class set on **both** elements so title and content stay aligned.

### i18n

Supported languages: `en` (en-US) and `de` (de-DE). Stored in localStorage key `zerf.ui-language`. Default: English. Locale used for `Intl` date/time formatting.

### API integration

- Base URL: `/api/v1` (relative to origin)
- CSRF token received from `GET /auth/me` or login response; sent as `X-CSRF-Token` header
- 401 triggers session-expiry handler (except on auth endpoints); a gate prevents duplicate handlers from concurrent requests
- `ZERF_FRONTEND_DEBUG_BUILD=true` disables minification and adds sourcemaps

## API routes (summary)

```
/auth/*             Login, logout, setup, forgot/reset password, preferences
/time-entries/*     CRUD, submit, batch-approve, batch-reject
/flextime-adjustments/{id}/reverse  Cancel a flextime entry out (admin; no delete exists)
/absences/*         CRUD, approve, reject, revoke, calendar, leave balances
/reopen-requests/*  Create, list pending, approve/reject
/users/*            CRUD, deactivate, reset password, leave-account entitlements, flextime account
/categories/*       CRUD
/holidays/*         CRUD, country/region lists
/reports/*          Month, range, team, categories, overtime, flextime, CSV
/audit-log          Read audit history
/settings/*         Public and admin settings, uploads, payroll report
/notifications/*    List, mark read, dismiss
```

## Security model

- **Passwords**: Argon2id; 5 failed attempts per 15 min lockout
- **Sessions**: 256-bit random tokens (HttpOnly/Secure/SameSite=Strict), 4d idle / 14d absolute timeout
- **CSRF**: SameSite=Strict + Origin/Referer check + X-CSRF-Token double-submit
- **Database auth**: SCRAM-SHA-256, checksums, internal-only Docker network
- **Data at rest**: [pg_tde](https://docs.percona.com/pg-tde/) (Percona Transparent Data Encryption) encrypts all tables and WAL segments at the PostgreSQL storage layer. The pg_tde principal key is auto-generated on first start, then encrypted with `ZERF_DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (AES-256-CBC, PBKDF2) and stored as `pg_tde_keyring.enc` in the data volume. On each container start the custom entrypoint decrypts the blob into a Docker-managed in-memory tmpfs (`/var/lib/pg_tde_keyring`); no elevated container capabilities are needed.
- **Backups**: Each backup is a zip archive (`zerf-<ts>.zip`) whose `dump.enc` entry is AES-256-CBC encrypted (PBKDF2, 100 000 iterations) using the same `ZERF_DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY`. One key governs both layers.
- **Audit log**: All mutations logged with JSON snapshots; passwords and secrets never logged
- **Password reset**: One-time 1h tokens, forced change on first login

## Deployment

Two Docker Compose configurations in `docker/` (`docker-compose-public.yml` is an
overlay applied on top of the local file, not a standalone stack):

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `docker-compose-local.yml` | Local stack (supports `DEBUG=true` via `.env`) |
| `docker-compose-public.yml` | Public deployment overlay: adds Caddy, drops the host port |

Caddy handles HTTPS termination and serves the frontend static assets. Backend listens on port 3333.

> ⚠ **Local mode is LAN-only.** `start_local.sh` publishes the app on
> `0.0.0.0:3333` with `ZERF_SECURE_COOKIES=false` and `ZERF_ENFORCE_ORIGIN=false`
> (plaintext HTTP, no Origin enforcement; CSRF tokens are still enforced). This is
> intended for a trusted LAN only. **Never expose a local-mode host to the
> internet** — session cookies would travel in cleartext. For any internet-facing
> deployment use `start_public.sh`, which terminates TLS at Caddy and re-enables
> secure cookies and Origin enforcement.

The PostgreSQL container is built from `docker/postgres.Dockerfile` (based on `percona/percona-distribution-postgresql:18`, which bundles pg_tde). A custom entrypoint (`docker/entrypoint-postgres.sh`) decrypts the pg_tde keyring from the data volume into an in-memory tmpfs before handing off to the official postgres entrypoint. The container runs with `cap_drop: [ALL]` and re-adds only the minimal capability set its root→gosu startup needs (`CHOWN`, `DAC_OVERRIDE`, `FOWNER`, `SETUID`, `SETGID`); `app` and `backup` run with `cap_drop: [ALL]` and no added capabilities. All three set `no-new-privileges`.

### Docker images

| Image | Dockerfile | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| `zerf-time-absence-management` | `docker/app.Dockerfile` | Rust/Axum backend + frontend assets |
| `zerf-time-absence-management-postgres` | `docker/postgres.Dockerfile` | Percona PostgreSQL 18 with pg_tde |
| `zerf-time-absence-management-caddy` | `docker/Caddyfile.Dockerfile` | Caddy reverse proxy (built with the caddy-ratelimit module) |
| `zerf-time-absence-management-backup` | `docker/backup.Dockerfile` | PostgreSQL 18 client + curl, with `scripts/backup.sh` baked in (self-contained — no host bind-mount). Built from the repo root so the script is in the build context. |

The `backup` service in `docker-compose-local.yml` is connected to two networks:
- `backup_net` — internal network shared with `db`, required for `pg_dump`.
- `backup_egress` — non-internal network for outbound HTTPS to Nextcloud. The app container is **not** in this network.

### Start scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `start_local.sh` | Start local stack (set `DEBUG=true` in `.env` for debug build) |
| `start_public.sh` | Start public stack |
| `scripts/backup.sh` | Dump, AES-encrypt, and bundle into a single zip archive (`zerf-<ts>.zip`, or `zerf-<ts>-manual.zip` for an on-demand backup — see `backup_requested_at` below), then optionally upload that archive to a Nextcloud share. The zip contains `dump.enc` (encrypted pg_dump), `metadata` (plaintext provenance), and — when the keyring volume is mounted at `/keyring-src` — `keyring.enc` (already-AES-encrypted pg_tde keyring for physical PGDATA recovery). Backup interval is read from `app_settings` at runtime via `psql`; local retention is a fixed count (the 10 most recent archives), tracked independently for scheduled and manual runs so repeated manual backups can never evict scheduled history. Refactored into sourceable functions (guarded by `BACKUP_LIB_ONLY=1`) for bats unit tests. |
| `scripts/restore.sh` | Interactive: extract and decrypt a backup archive, then restore it into the live instance. Supports both the new zip format (`zerf-<ts>.zip`) and legacy encrypted dumps (`zerf-<ts>.dump.enc`). `--keyring [DIR]` extracts the `keyring.enc` entry from the selected archive for physical recovery without touching the database. Container names, the backup volume, and the `.env` path default to the production values but are overridable (`ZERF_RESTORE_POSTGRES_CONTAINER`, `ZERF_RESTORE_APP_CONTAINER`, `ZERF_RESTORE_BACKUP_VOLUME`, `ZERF_RESTORE_ENV_FILE`) — used by `e2e/backup-restore-check.sh` to run it non-interactively against the isolated e2e stack. Requires `unzip` on the host. |
| `scripts/backup.bats` | bats unit tests for `backup.sh` helper functions (parse_share_url, interval resolution, upload credential handling, 0-byte rejection, zip archive creation with and without keyring, keyring-copy failure handling, retention pruning). Requires `zip` and `unzip` in the test environment. |
| `e2e/backup-restore-check.sh` | Final step of `e2e/run.sh`: triggers a real backup cycle, verifies the zip archive and its entries (dump.enc, metadata, keyring.enc), mutates the live e2e database, restores via `scripts/restore.sh`, and verifies the mutation is undone, every table's row count matches the pre-backup snapshot, and (via `e2e/post-restore-ui-check.mjs`, a real browser) the restored data renders in the app's UI. |

### Disaster recovery prerequisites

The database is encrypted at rest with pg_tde, and the keyring is wrapped with
`ZERF_DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY`. **Two distinct artifacts are required to read the data —
losing either renders the database unrecoverable:**

1. `ZERF_DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (from `.env`). `deploy.sh` never overwrites an existing
   key for exactly this reason.
2. The pg_tde keyring. It lives in the **`zerf_postgres_data`** volume
   (`/data/pg_tde_keyring.enc`), which is **separate** from the data directory in
   **`zerf_postgres_db_data`** (`/data/db`). A filesystem/volume snapshot that
   captures only the data volume **cannot be decrypted**.

For recovery you therefore need **either** both volumes (`zerf_postgres_db_data`
*and* `zerf_postgres_data`) **or** a logical backup archive `zerf-<ts>.zip` plus the
key. Each backup archive bundles a `keyring.enc` entry so an orphaned, encrypted
data volume can still be recovered with `scripts/restore.sh --keyring`.

### Key environment variables (encryption)

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `ZERF_DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Single passphrase that wraps the pg_tde keyring (DB at rest) and encrypts backups via openssl. Generate: `openssl rand -hex 32`. **Losing this key makes both the database and all backups unreadable.** |

### Backup and upload settings (app_settings)

Backup frequency, Nextcloud upload, and payroll report settings are stored in `app_settings` (not in `.env`) and are editable in the Admin UI under **Nextcloud Backups** and **Payroll Report**. The backup container reads them via `psql` at the start of each cycle. Local retention is not configurable — the 10 most recent backups are always kept, tracked separately for scheduled and manual runs (see `backup_requested_at` below).

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `backup_interval_days` | 1 | Days between backup cycles |
| `backup_last_success_at` | — | UTC timestamp of the last successful **scheduled** backup; `is_backup_due` measures the interval from this. Written only by `scripts/backup.sh`, never by a manual run |
| `backup_requested_at` | — | Set by the admin's **Back up now** button (`request_backup_now`); the backup container's loop polls for a value it hasn't already handled (~every 20s, via `sleep_until_deadline_or_request` — which every sleep in the loop routes through, including the post-failure backoff) and runs an immediate backup. Never cleared by the app — the script tracks what it has handled itself (`backup_last_request_handled_at`, script-internal, no Rust constant), so a failed clear can't cause a repeat-backup loop. Not directly user-editable |
| `backup_last_manual_at` | — | UTC timestamp of the last successful **manual** backup, kept separate from `backup_last_success_at` so an on-demand backup never postpones or starves the schedule. The Admin UI shows the more recent of the two |
| `backup_upload_enabled` | false | Enable upload to Nextcloud |
| `backup_upload_url` | — | Nextcloud public share URL (`https://…/s/<token>`) |
| `backup_upload_password` | — | Optional share password (write-only) |
| `report_upload_enabled` | false | Enable monthly timesheet PDF upload |
| `report_upload_url` | — | Nextcloud public share URL for timesheets |
| `report_upload_password` | — | Optional share password (write-only) |
| `report_upload_day_of_month` | 5 | Day of month to upload previous month's PDF |
| `payroll_report_enabled` | false | Email the monthly payroll report |
| `payroll_report_recipient` | — | Comma-separated recipient addresses (tax office / payroll accountant). Singular key name, list value — see `parse_recipient_list` |
| `payroll_report_day_of_month` | 5 | Day of month the previous month's report is prepared |
| `payroll_report_include_assistant_hours` | true | List assistants' working days and hours |
| `payroll_report_include_employee_hours` | false | List all other employees' working days and hours |
| `payroll_report_excluded_users` | — | Comma-separated user IDs left out of the report entirely (they also stop blocking delivery). Admins are excluded unconditionally and never listed here |

The earlier `backup_interval_seconds`/`backup_retention_days` keys are gone: migration 023 replaced the interval with `backup_interval_days`, and migration 024 dropped the retention setting in favour of a fixed count (the 10 most recent backups). Neither is set via environment variables.

`payroll_report_absence_categories` is also gone: migration 036 removed it because the report now derives its categories automatically from `AbsenceCategory::is_payroll_relevant`. The key still appears read-only in `AdminSettingsData` so the UI can show which categories are currently included.

**Payroll report delivery rules** (`background/payroll_report.rs`): three send
modes, `SendMode`. `Scheduled` (nightly) sends only once every covered person's
month is final — a blocked month is logged, never raised as an error
notification — and deletes the queue entry once SMTP accepts it. The admin
"Send now" button never deletes a queue entry and picks its month via
`services::payroll_report::manual_send_target`: the oldest month still owed
(already queued, *or* one the next run's backfill would queue — both lists must
be consulted or the button names one month and sends another), else the month
currently running. An owed month goes out as `ManualPartial`: whoever is final,
with the rest named as missing in PDF and email. The running month goes out as
`ManualSnapshot`: no readiness gate at all, only people who booked something,
window clamped to today (absence rows do not self-clamp the way worked hours
do), and refused outright unless `people_in_report` finds somebody — only
approved data reaches the tables, so a booked-but-unapproved month would
otherwise mail an empty document. `ManualSnapshot` therefore deliberately uses
a *different* member filter and window from the dashboard tile; the two agree
only for a finished month. Enabling the report at all requires
`load_smtp_config()` to be `Some`, and disabling SMTP switches it back off
(`update_smtp_settings`). Two lead-only endpoints back the dashboard's month cards.
`GET /reports/submission-status` (`build_submission_status`) is the **Submissions**
card: who has closed their month, judged with the week criterion and full
approval for everyone. It no longer mirrors the payroll gate — the report does
not wait on unhanded-in weeks — so it is independent of whether the payroll
report is enabled at all. `GET /reports/payroll-content` (`build_content`) is the
**Payroll Report** card: it runs the very code that assembles the document
(`build_report_data`) on the same member set and window the matching send mode
would use, so the card cannot claim something the PDF would not print; names of people
outside a team lead's own team are stripped server-side. "Already delivered" is derived from the queue (period reached `payroll_report_queue_period` **and** no longer in `payroll_report_queue`) rather than a stored marker, so it is correct on installations that predate the card. The tile's amber/red split cannot be read off `MonthExportReadiness` alone: the gate returns `PendingAbsenceRequests` before it checks week submission, so `status_for_member` re-checks `all_weeks_submitted_for_month` to keep "still owes weeks" red. The dashboard re-fetches the status when the detail dialog is opened (`Dashboard.svelte`'s `openPayrollDetail`), because approvals granted on that page are exactly what the reader opens the list to verify.

### Integration tests

Integration tests use `testcontainers_modules::postgres::Postgres` (plain `postgres:17` image, no pg_tde). This is intentional: pg_tde is a deployment concern and has no effect on application logic or SQL correctness. `postgres:17` (Debian) is used rather than the module default (`11-alpine`) because lz4 TOAST compression requires PostgreSQL 14+ compiled with `--with-lz4`, which is included in the official Debian-based `postgres:17` image.

## Testing

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run lint   # see Linting section above — must pass before committing
npm test -- --run && npm run build
```

Tests use Vitest + jsdom. Test files are co-located with source under `src/` and `src/routes/`.

> **Note:** Lint is not part of CI — run it locally before committing.

### End-to-end (browser)

```bash
./e2e/run.sh
```

A single realistic [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) scenario in `e2e/` runs
against a **freshly provisioned, production-like Docker stack** (postgres with
pg_tde, the app, and the backup sidecar — the same services `start_local.sh`
brings up). The bash script `e2e/run.sh` is the entry point: it writes an
isolated env file with generated secrets, runs `docker compose ... up --build
--wait` under a dedicated project name (`zerf_e2e`), waits for the API, runs the
flow in `e2e/tests/full-flow.spec.js`, and always tears the stack down (`down
-v`) on exit.

The flow exercises the real UI: bootstrap the first admin → admin completes
first-run settings → admin creates an employee (reads the generated temporary
password) → employee changes the password, books time entries, submits the week,
and requests two absences → admin sees every pending request on the dashboard and
approves them. Admin and employee use separate browser contexts so both sessions
stay live at once.

Requires Docker + Node 22. First run builds images (several minutes); set
`ZERF_E2E_KEEP_UP=1` to keep the stack up for iterating with
`cd e2e && npx playwright test`. CI runs this as the `e2e` job (after the
`rust` and `frontend` jobs). See `e2e/README.md` for details.

### Backend

```bash
cd backend

# Unit tests only (no database required, ~3 s)
cargo test --lib

# Integration tests with Docker (each test gets its own container)
cargo test --test integration

# Integration tests without Docker — requires a local PostgreSQL instance
TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgres://<role>:<password>@127.0.0.1/<admin-db> cargo test --test integration
```

**Integration test isolation:** every `TestApp::spawn()` call creates a unique database
(`zerf_test_{pid}_{counter}`), migrates it, seeds it, and drops it via `cleanup()`.
Tests never share rows, ports, or sessions — parallel execution is safe.

**Parallelism:** `.cargo/config.toml` sets `test-threads = 8` by default, matching the
8-CPU dev container. Each test pool uses 3 connections max; peak usage is ~24 connections.
PostgreSQL `max_connections` must be ≥ 50 (set to 200 in the dev container).
The full suite runs in ~2 minutes.

**Running without Docker (local PostgreSQL):**

- Start PostgreSQL: `pg_ctlcluster 14 main start` (or `service postgresql start`).
- Verify: `pg_isready -h 127.0.0.1`.
- The local superuser role is `vscode` in this dev container. Enable TCP auth if needed:
  ```bash
  psql -h /var/run/postgresql -U vscode -d postgres -c "ALTER USER vscode PASSWORD 'secret';"
  ```
- Run tests:
  ```bash
  TEST_REFERENCE_DATE=2030-01-07 TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgres://vscode:secret@127.0.0.1/postgres cargo test --test integration
  ```

  > **Important:** Always set `TEST_REFERENCE_DATE=2030-01-07` (a Monday with no nearby public holidays)
  > when running locally. Without it the helpers fall back to wall-clock time and date-relative tests
  > will fail whenever today's date lands on or near a public holiday.

**Cleaning up between runs:**

Each test creates an isolated database (`zerf_test_{pid}_{counter}`) and drops it in `cleanup()`.
If a test run is killed mid-flight (e.g. Ctrl-C, OOM, crash), those databases are left behind and
accumulate over time. They do not affect correctness but they consume disk space and connections.
Drop them before the next run to start with a clean slate:

```bash
# List leftover test databases
psql -U vscode -h 127.0.0.1 postgres -c \
  "SELECT datname FROM pg_database WHERE datname LIKE 'zerf_test_%';"

# Drop all leftover test databases in one shot
psql -U vscode -h 127.0.0.1 postgres -t -c \
  "SELECT 'DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS \"' || datname || '\";' FROM pg_database WHERE datname LIKE 'zerf_test_%';" \
  | psql -U vscode -h 127.0.0.1 postgres
```

> **Note:** PostgreSQL must be restarted if it crashed mid-run (WAL recovery after an unclean
> shutdown can take up to 60 s before accepting connections):
> ```bash
> pg_ctlcluster 14 main stop -m immediate && pg_ctlcluster 14 main start
> # then wait:
> until pg_isready; do sleep 2; done
> ```

**Verification after changes:**

```bash
cargo build                              # zero compilation errors
cargo clippy -- -D warnings             # zero warnings
cargo test --lib                        # unit tests (no DB)
TEST_REFERENCE_DATE=2030-01-07 TEST_DATABASE_URL=... cargo test  # full suite including integration
grep -rn "sqlx::" backend/src/handlers/ # must be empty (no SQL in handlers)
grep -rn "axum::extract\|axum::response\|axum::routing\|axum::Json" backend/src/services/ # must be empty
```

`backend/tests/nager_contract.rs` validates the external Nager.Date holiday API contract.

## Coding Conventions

- Use explicit, descriptive variable and function names that reveal intent without requiring a comment.
- Prioritize readability for humans over brevity; code is read far more often than it is written.
- Keep functions and modules small and focused on a single responsibility.
- Reduce complexity: avoid unnecessary abstractions, indirection, and nesting.
- Prefer simple, direct solutions over clever ones. Keep it concise.
- Apply appropriate architectural patterns (e.g., handler/service/repository separation) consistently across the codebase.
- Keep database logic in repository modules only; handlers/services orchestrate business flow and call repository APIs.
- Do not introduce new `sqlx::query*` calls outside `backend/src/repository/*.rs`.
- Prefer adding repository methods over duplicating SQL in callers.
- Add comprehensive inline comments e. g. explaining decisions, intent and high-level logic.
- Translate all texts that are displayed to the user (UI, errors, E-Mail, etc.)
- Translations must be handled centrally in i18n.rs for the backend and i18n.js for the frontend.
- Frontend styling lives in CSS only — never in inline `style=` attributes. See the Styling section above for where rules belong.
- Update docs/user-guide.md to reflect the correct app behavior. It is a document meant for human users and should not contain technical background, but the mere user-view behavior. Use natural, simple and concise language.

### Migrations

- **Every migration must be idempotent.** Use `CREATE TABLE/INDEX … IF NOT EXISTS`,
  `ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`, `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, and
  guarded `DO $$ … $$` blocks. A migration must be safe to re-run against a database
  that already has the change.
- **Never edit a migration that has already been committed/applied.** The app runs
  `sqlx::migrate!()` (`backend/src/db.rs`), which **checksums every applied migration
  on startup**; changing a committed migration's bytes triggers a `VersionMismatch`
  error and the **live application refuses to boot**. To change schema, always add a
  new, higher-numbered migration.

## Release Process

Commits follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format — git-cliff reads them to generate the changelog automatically.

Tag and push — the CI release workflow takes it from there:

```bash
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z"
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

The CI release workflow (`release.yml`) then:
1. Injects the tag version into `Cargo.toml` and `package.json` (no commit)
2. Builds and pushes all four Docker images (app, postgres, caddy, backup) tagged with the version and `latest`
3. Generates the changelog via git-cliff and creates a GitHub Release with it as release notes
